              Enthusiastic Fullstack Dev from Germany 
              with a pivot towards backend. My background in 
              archaeology has taught me a great deal about managing 
              projects and quality standards. As a process-oriented 
              professional, I care deeply about well-functioning 
              teams, clearly formulated goals and priorities, 
              as well as agile structures and strategies.
