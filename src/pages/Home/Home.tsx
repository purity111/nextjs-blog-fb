            Enthusiastic Fullstack Dev from Germany 
            with a pivot towards backend. My background in 
            archaeology has taught me a great deal about managing 
            projects and quality standards. As a process-oriented 
            professional, I care deeply about well-functioning 
            teams, clearly formulated goals and priorities, 
            as well as agile structures and strategies.
